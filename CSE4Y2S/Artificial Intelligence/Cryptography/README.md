## Lab Exercises

### 1. Caesar Cipher
**Objective**:  
Encrypt a given line of text using the Caesar Cipher (shift by 3 modulo 26). Then reverse the process to recover the original plaintext.

### 2. Polygram Substitution Cipher
**Objective**:  
Encrypt a given plaintext using a Polygram Substitution Cipher (block size of 3). Then reverse the process to recover the original plaintext.

### 3. Transposition Cipher
**Objective**:  
Encrypt the plaintext message "DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY UNIVERSITY OF RAJSHAHI BANGLADESH" using the Transposition Cipher (width provided as input). Reverse the process to get the original plaintext.

### 4. Double Transposition Cipher
**Objective**:  
Encrypt the above plaintext using the Double Transposition Cipher. Then reverse the process to recover the original plaintext.

### 5. One-Time Pad Cipher
**Objective**:  
Encrypt a plaintext using a truly random, non-repeating key from a file using the One-Time Pad technique. Reverse the operation to retrieve the original plaintext.

### 6. Lehmann Algorithm for Primality Testing
**Objective**:  
Write a program to check whether a given number `P` is prime using the Lehmann primality test algorithm.

### 7. Rabin-Miller Primality Test
**Objective**:  
Write a program to check whether a given number `P` is prime using the Rabin-Miller primality test algorithm.

### 8. MD5 Hash Function
**Objective**:  
Write a program to implement the MD5 one-way hash function.

### 9. Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)
**Objective**:  
Write a program to implement the Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA).

### 10. RSA Algorithm
**Objective**:  
Encrypt a plaintext message using the RSA algorithm. Reverse the process to recover the original plaintext.

### 11. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
**Objective**:  
Write a program to implement the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol.
